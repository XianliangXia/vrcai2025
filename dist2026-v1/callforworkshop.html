                    <p>The International Conference on Virtual Reality Continuum and its Applications (VRCAI 2026) is a
                        premier event in the rapidly evolving fields of virtual reality, augmented reality, and their
                        applications. It will be held in Hangzhou, China, in November 2026.</p>

                    <p>The conference will cover all topics in the areas of computing, interaction, and visualization
                        related to the Virtual Reality Continuum, and will feature keynote talks, technical symposia,
                        distinguished lectures, and workshops.</p>

                    <p>The theme for VRCAI 2026 highlights the application of AI-driven contextual understanding in
                        creating seamless and
                        sustainable immersive experiences.</p>

                    <p>We invite proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction with VRCAI 2026. Workshops provide a
                        platform for researchers and practitioners to present and discuss novel ideas, emerging trends,
                        and cutting-edge applications in a more focused and interactive setting.</p>
