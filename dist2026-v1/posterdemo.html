                21st International Conference on Virtual Reality Continuum and its Applications<br>
                (ACM SIGGRAPH VRCAI 2026)
            </h1>

                <div style="margin-top: 5px">
                    <p>VRCAI 2026 invites submissions of original Posters and Demos that showcase innovative research,
                        technical prototypes, practical applications, and art-technology integrated creations at the
                        intersection of the Virtual Reality Continuum (VRC) and related fields. As a complement to the
                        conference's paper track, the Poster & Demo session serves as a dynamic platform for interactive
                        presentation, in-depth discussion, and visual demonstration of cutting-edge work in VR, AR, MR,
                        AV, XR, Virtual Storytelling, Virtual Production and beyond.</p>

                    <p>Notably, outstanding submissions with high artistic value (while retaining close integration with
                        VR/AR core technologies, no pure artistic works accepted) will be selected for a special VR/AR
                        Art Exhibition segment at VRCAI 2026, offering a dedicated space for immersive artistic display
                        and academic-arts exchange. All accepted Posters and Demos will be featured in the on-site
                        exhibition area of the conference, with creators having the opportunity to present their work to
                        international academia, industry professionals, and art and technology practitioners.</p>

                    <p>Since its inception in 1993, VRCAI has evolved into a globally renowned conference with a strong
                        industry-academia integration focus. The Poster & Demo track aligns with the conference's
                        mission to foster the development of the VRC ecosystem, highlighting the latest advancements in
                        digital innovation that bridges the physical and virtual worlds. This track welcomes diverse
                        submissions that balance technical rigor, practical applicability, and creative expression, and
                        encourages cross-disciplinary collaborations between technology and art.</p>
